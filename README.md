# 🌦️ Statistical Analysis of Climate Variability Across India (1980–2023)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive statistical study of climate variability** across India's diverse climatic regions over a 43-year period (1980–2023). Utilizing daily meteorological data from **seven strategically selected cities** (New Delhi, Jodhpur, Guwahati, Bhopal, Mumbai, Chennai, and Thiruvananthapuram), the study investigates the spatial and temporal dynamics of key climate variables such as **temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and evaporation**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze seasonal and annual patterns in surface climate data
- Explore inter-relationships between temperature, rainfall, wind, and evaporation
- Detect long-term regional trends using **time series decomposition**
- Identify **extreme events** (e.g., heatwaves, heavy rainfall) using **GEV distribution**
- Conduct multivariate comparison through **ANOVA and post hoc tests**
- Support data-driven policy planning in **urban development**, **climate adaptation**, and **public health**

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data Source**: Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)
- **Preprocessing**: Interpolation & Weighted Moving Average (WMA) for missing values, formatting, and monthly/annual aggregation
- **Statistical Tools**:
  - Descriptive & exploratory analysis (correlation heatmaps, boxplots, histograms)
  - Time series analysis (trend, seasonality, residuals)
  - Extreme value modeling with **GEV distribution** and **K-S test**
  - ANOVA + **Tukey’s HSD** for regional comparison

## 🌍 Key Findings

- Notable regional differences in climate variability patterns
- Rising temperature trends in arid and inland regions (e.g., Jodhpur, Bhopal)
- Coastal cities show more stable temperature profiles but high rainfall variability
- Significant correlations between temperature and rainfall in humid zones
- Increasing return levels for extreme temperature and rainfall events over time

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- **Excel** for data transformation and visualization
- **Statistical Modeling**: Time Series, GEV, ANOVA
